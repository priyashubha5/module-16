     <p style = 'font-size: 20px; color: white; text-align: justify; margin: 5px;'>The planet’s largest and most dangerous
seismic zone is the Pacific ring of fire.
90% of all earthquakes<br>strike here. On
11 March 2011, a magnitude 9
earthquake caused by Japan’s position
on the Ring of Fire<br>violently shook
Tohoku, Northeastern Japan, causing
building to collapse and people to flee
for their<br>lives. But that is not end of the
destruction. A defining characteristic of
the Pacific ring of fire is that<br>the biggest
earthquakes there shake not only the
land but also the seabed, generating
huge surges of<br>waters. The earthquake
of March 11, 2011 generated a deadly
tsunami that killed almost 16,000
people.<br>One of the secrets of the Pacific
Ocean is a tectonic monster, 150 miles
of the coast from the cities<br>of Seattle,
Vancouver and Portland known the
Cascadia subduction zone. Our planet’s
core is made of molten iron which is
surrounded with a thick mantle. That
outer crust is divided into tectonic plates
which are constantly in motion. But their
movement is extremely slow, in a year
they move about 2 to 5 centimeters.
When 2 tectonic plates collide, they
thrust mountains upwards and carve
deep trenches in the ocean floor as 1
plate drives the other back inside the

earth. If these plates lock together,
tremendous pressure is begins to build.
This creates a subduction zone. When
pressure is released it has the potential
to create earthquakes of magnitude 9.0
and higher. But that’s not all, subduction
zones, being underwater, can cause not
only earthquakes but deadly tsunamis.
In 1700, the Cascadia subduction zone
produced an earthquake with a
magnitude of 9.0 and created tsunamis
which flooded both Cascadia, and Japan
almost 4500 miles.</p>
